# Quizzler

A basic Next.js site scaffold for Quizzler.

Select a quiz topic from the drop-down and type the names to guess them. If you get stuck, hit the **Give Up** button to reveal all of the answers.

Pokemon type icons are provided by [pokemon-type-svg-icons](https://github.com/duiker101/pokemon-type-svg-icons).

In the Pokémon quiz, toggle **Show types** to display each Pokémon's type icons next to its answer.
Hover over a type icon to see its type name.

Use **Reduce guessed answers** to hide a guessed answer only when its neighbors have been guessed as well.
